					<h1>Professional Summary</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am a highly motivated and accomplished cybersecurity professional with a strong academic background and extensive hands-on experience in penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, secure software development, and IT support. Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Cybersecurity at New York University (NYU) with a perfect 4.00 GPA, I previously earned a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity (Summa Cum Laude) from Florida International University (FIU), where I graduated with a 3.98 GPA and was recognized as the #1 Outstanding Graduate in Cybersecurity.

						My academic excellence is complemented by practical experience, including my current role as a Teaching Assistant for Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis at NYU. In this position, I guide students in ethical hacking methodologies, exploit development, and reporting best practices. I evaluate student-executed penetration tests, conduct technical reviews of exploit code, and provide guidance on various pentesting techniques.
						
						As an Information Technology Intern at FIU, I developed Python scripts to automate vulnerability testing and risk assessments, conducted security audits, and supported secure architecture design. In my role as a Student Tutor and Cybersecurity Technician, I led the setup of a secure lab for ethical hacking, tutored over 200 students in cybersecurity and computer science topics, and secured Linux virtual machines for penetration testing exercises.
						My experience as a Student Web Developer at Stetson University allowed me to audit source code for security flaws, transition Bootstrap frameworks, and develop dynamic websites using PHP, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I implemented security best practices to prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
						
						I have demonstrated leadership skills through my positions as Vice-President & Researcher at NYU's OSIRIS Cybersecurity Club and President of FIU's KFSCIS Student Advisory Council. In these roles, I've led research initiatives, workshops, and advocated for student interests.
						My technical skills include proficiency in tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp Suite, as well as programming languages such as Python, Bash, and Java. I'm also experienced with various operating systems, including Windows and multiple Linux distributions.
						
						One of my significant achievements was leading the SecureHaven project at FIU, where I identified and resolved 871 vulnerabilities using Snyk AI and the NIST framework. This project showcased my ability to handle large-scale security challenges and implement effective solutions.
						
						As a blog writer on Medium, I am committed to sharing my knowledge and insights with the cybersecurity community, contributing to the ongoing dialogue about emerging threats and best practices in the field.
						
						My passion for cybersecurity, combined with my technical expertise, leadership experience, and commitment to education, positions me to make significant contributions to the industry. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to advance the field of cybersecurity.</p>
